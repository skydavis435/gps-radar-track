# gps-radar-track
Match radar track data to GPS data and generate statistics on the radar accuracy of tracked targets. 

To evaluate the performance of a tracking radar a milimeter accurate GPS was attached to a vehicle and driven around a test range on an airport. All of the radar tracks during the test were exported and the GPS data was used to locate the correct radar track (time, location, heading, speed). Once datasets were combined and matching tracks identified, statistics on the accuracy of the tracking radar were computed. 

Adjustments can be made for time synchronization issues between devices and all radar tracks matching GPS data are plotted for manual verification, if desired.
